# ETL Process:

The project primarily involved an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to gather data from various sources. 
The ETL process helped consolidate diverse data, making it easier to analyze effectively.

# Data Cleaning:

After extraction, a data cleaning step was applied to remove inconsistencies and ensure high data quality. This step is crucial for accurate analysis and reliable insights.

# Analysis and Insights:

The clean data was analyzed to derive insights tailored for strategic business decisions. 
These insights were aimed at optimizing operations, enhancing performance, and supporting decision-making in the competitive e-commerce space​(E-Commerce Python Proje…).

# 
This project underlines the use of Python for data handling in e-commerce, showing how ETL and data analysis can support key business areas like operations and strategic planning.
